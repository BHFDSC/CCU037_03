# Towards mitigating health inequity via machine learning: a nationwide cohort study to develop and validate ethnicity-specific models for prediction of cardiovascular disease risk in COVID-19 patients

## Project description

Emerging data-driven technologies in healthcare, such as risk prediction models, hold great promise but also pose challenges regarding potential bias and exacerbation of existing health inequalities, which have been observed across diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19. This study addresses the impact of ethnicity in risk prediction modelling for cardiovascular events following SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores the potential of ethnicity-specific models to mitigate disparities.
